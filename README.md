# github_pr_metrics
A Python script that can be used to pull PR metrics from GitHub (how many PRs users have opened and reviewed) and outputs it to csvs

## Directions
1. Clone repo locally
2. Ensure you have latests version of python installed
3. Make the github_metrics_script.py file executable (chmod +x github_metrics_script.py for those of you using Linux or Unix)
3. Go to the file location and run ```python github_metrics_script.py```
4. Look in the directory you ran the script in and you should see csvs!
5. Have any issues? Contact me. This is a scratch script in progress and I'm sure a lot of other people have written similar scripts with cleaner Python.
